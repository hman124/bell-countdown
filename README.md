# [Bell Countdown](https://bell-countdown.netlify.app)

A React web app designed to tell useful information like how much time is left in the current class period.

As it turns out, it's more useful than you think. This is still in development and is mostly just a learning/testing project, but it definitely has some real implications.

For now, the schedule is set to the schedule of my school, but in the (near) future, I will be adding support for custom schedules, a feature most similar apps i've found don't have.

It can be viewed live here: https://bell-countdown.netlify.app/<br>
And you can see the code here on github
